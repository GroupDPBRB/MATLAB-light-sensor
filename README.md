# MATLAB-light-sensor
A student project for ENGR114 at Portland Community College. Uses MATLAB to read a light sensor connected to an Arudino over serial.

## Problem Statement
Our group will collect measurements from our developed light sensor to output and
display a Light vs Time plot.

## Hardware Setup

### Bill of Materials

## Arduino Code
The [light_sensor.ino](light_sensor.ino) sketch was uploaded on the Arduino using the Arduino IDE

## MATLAB Code
The [light_sensor.m](light_sensor.m) script was run in MATLAB.

## Results

## Future Work
Other groups can add more LED lights to enhance the accuracy of data
observation and collection.
